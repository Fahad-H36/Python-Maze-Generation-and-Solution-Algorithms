There are Five Scripts in this repository

1. maze_generation.py => Generates a square maze (size*size) with the Recursive Backtracking technique
2. sidewinder.py =>  Generates a square maze (size*size) with the sidewinder technique
3. recursive.py => Generates a square maze (size*size) with the Recursive Division technique
4. aStar.py => Solves a square maze (size*size) with the AStar technique
5. main.py => Driver Script
